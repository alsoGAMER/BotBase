# BotBase - Methods overview

BotBase has a builtin wrapper around Pyrogram objects that make
it even easier to use them properly.

**DISCLAIMER**: The ``MethodWrapper`` class is just a wrapper around Pyrogram. 


To use the "safe" methods, just import the `MethodWrapper` class from `BotBase.methods`
and pass it a `pyrogram.Client` **instance** (not the class) or a `pyrogram.CallbackQuery`
or even a `pyrogram.InlineQuery` object. Then you can just call `wrapper.method` rather than `client.method`.

This way, the calls will never trigger `RPCError` and will log errors to stderr.
If an exception occurs, the exception object is returned, otherwise whatever
the called pyrogram method returns will be returned.
